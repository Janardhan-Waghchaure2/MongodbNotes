1. What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a opensource NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format. 
Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB uses JSON-like BSON documents instead of tables and rows.

2. Whats nosql?
nosql -> not only sql , nosql means it can handle structured , semistrucured , no-structured data.

3. diff between RDBMS/SQL vs NOSQL?
    
    ### **1. Data Model**
    | Feature      | RDBMS (SQL) | NoSQL |
    |-------------|------------|--------|
    | **Structure** | Fixed schema (tables, rows, columns) | Flexible schema (documents, key-value, graph, column-family) |
    | **Relationships** | Uses joins for relational data | No joins; uses embedded/nested documents |
    
    ### **2. Scalability**
    | Feature      | RDBMS (SQL) | NoSQL |
    |-------------|------------|--------|
    | **Scaling Type** | Vertical scaling (adding resources to a single server) | Horizontal scaling (distributing across multiple servers) |
    | **Performance** | Can slow down with large datasets due to joins | Faster reads/writes with distributed systems |
    
    ### **3. Transactions & Consistency**
    | Feature      | RDBMS (SQL) | NoSQL |
    |-------------|------------|--------|
    | **ACID Compliance** | Fully ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | May prioritize eventual consistency over strict ACID |
    | **Use Case** | Banking, inventory, financial apps | Social media, big data, IoT, real-time apps |
    
    ### **4. Examples**
    - **RDBMS**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle
    - **NoSQL**: MongoDB (Document), Cassandra (Column-family), Redis (Key-value), Neo4j (Graph)
    
    ### **5. When to Use Which?**
    - ✅ **Use SQL when**: You need **strict consistency**, structured relationships, and transactions (e.g., banking, financial records).
    - ✅ **Use NoSQL when**: You need **fast reads/writes**, flexibility, and scalability for big data (e.g., real-time apps, social media).
